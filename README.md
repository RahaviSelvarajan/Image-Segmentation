#Blood Vessel Segmentation from Retinal Fundus Images
In blood vessel segmentation, after morphological filtration, CLAHE algorithm is applied, to improve the contrast of the fundus images since the background and the vessels have the same color. To eliminate noise and blobs from the image, green channel images are separated from RGB image and thresholding is done. Similarly, CLAHE based segmentation is done automatically to separate retinal blood vessels from fundus image.
